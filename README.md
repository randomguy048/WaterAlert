# Introducing the WaterAlert!
This device was made with hard work at Garry Middle School, by team 7 in the MESA class. This device is intended to be used by people who need help trying to drink water on a regular schedule, such as our elders, and other people. With that said, let's cut to the next section!

## How the code works:
* When powered on via a power supply, or battery pack, it will display "Hi", and shortly after it will make a startup sound. 
* The WaterAlert device will operate on an interval of 30 minutes for reminding a user to drink water, on an hour format. (0.5)
* Once the hours to remind timer has ran out, it will enter sleep mode, and one LED will remain on for the entire sleep duration of a user's desired setting. This feature can be turned off if needed.
* Once the sleep timer has ran out, it will sound a ending tone, and the hour timer will restart. 
* Button A will dismiss the reminder and it will make a tone to signal proper dismissal.
* Button B will show the version number.
* The button on the back has 2 functions. When a short press is detected, it will reboot and the timer will be reset, along with the variables resetting to its defaults. When a long press for 5 seconds is detected, it will shut off. You can turn it on by short pressing it again.

## Miscellaneous
The device will operate at 5 brightness. You may request to change it by contacting our support email at the bottom of the page.
